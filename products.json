Super soft and lightweight, Stitch & Story’s yarns are made from 100% merino wool (spun and dyed in Italy).</li> <li>About Us</li> <li>Stitch & Story was founded by two friends - both incidentally called Jen! Their passion in knitting gave them the inspiration to create Stitch & Story: the ultimate go-to for learning to knit, beginners' knitting kits and luxury, yummy yarns. With knitting often being dubbed as a granny hobby and impossible to learn, they've made extra effort to break away from these stereotypes by offering all-in-one, DIY kits with knitting patterns to reflect current fashion trends and lifestyle products.Our aim is to ensure knitters make the connection between the stress-free experience of knitting and the creation of an authentic, value-added product – one that isn’t embarrassing to wear or show-off!</li> <li>Join our knitting community</li> <li>We value all our customers and love keeping in touch to share tips, inspiration, and general knitter natter! We would love to hear from you either via email or social media @stitchandstory #yarnmazing.</li> <li>© Created by Stitch & Story , All Rights Reserved</li> <li>Photography may not be used without express written permission from Stitch & Story</li> <li>dimensions:</li> <li>12 x 11 x 38cm.
